/*

    khash function
    This function implements the khash algorithm, a simple and efficient hash function.
    It takes a 32-bit unsigned integer 'state' as input and returns a 32-bit unsigned integer as the hash value.
    The function applies a series of bitwise operations and multiplication with prime constants to scramble the input bits and produce the hash value.
    The khash algorithm consists of the following steps:
        XOR the 'state' with a constant value (2747636419).
        Multiply the result by another constant value (2654435769) using the wrapping multiplication to avoid overflow.
        XOR the result with the right-shifted version of itself by 16 bits.
        Repeat step 3 one more time.
        Multiply the final result by the same constant value (2654435769) using wrapping multiplication.
    The wrapping multiplication and XOR operations help ensure that the hash function produces a valid 32-bit unsigned integer without overflow issues.
    Although this hash function is not cryptographically secure, it is suitable for many non-cryptographic hash table implementations and other basic hashing needs.
